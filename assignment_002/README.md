# assignment_002: Image Classifcation Using FSEai Vision Functions

The task is to build a model, train and test the model using the fseai vision functions for the following datasets: FashionMNIST, CIFAR10
You need to follow the following steps and use the corresponding vision functions to ceate your model.

Step 1. Import the Dataset from pytoch torchvision Dataset using `input_dataset(name)`, by providing the name of the pytorch vision dataset.

Step 2: Visualize and explore the training Dataset using the `visualise_sampledata` function

Step 3: Use the `get_features` function to get the features from Dataset

Step 4: Build the model using the `build_model` function

Step 5: Train the model using the `train_model` function

Step 6: Use the `test_model` function to test your Model with the test data set aside from step 1

Step 7: Visualize you model performance by sample prediction using the `visualise_test` function
