# assignment_006: Build Categorical Cross Entropy from Scratch using numpy

# Build a function for computing the Cross Entroy for a multi class classification problem

# the function operates on two inputs: target label represented as one hot encoded vectors and
# the predicted probability of that label for a given observation passing from a softmax output layer.
