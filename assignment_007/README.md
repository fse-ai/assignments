# assignment_007: Training the Model with different Activations

The task is to build a model and train the model for MNIST Dataset with three different activations: sigmoid, ReLu, and tanh using the activation functions defined in 
assignment_005. Compare the training by plotting a graph for 'loss' vs 'epochs' for 3 different activations.
