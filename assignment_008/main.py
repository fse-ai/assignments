# assignment_008: Solving FashionMNIST using Neural Nets
# The task is to construct a Neural Network model, train the model on the FashionMNIST data set to be
# able to classify images into the different categories using PyTorch.

# Your codes here..
# Steps:
# 1. Define the neural network
# 2. Define the loss function and optimizer
# 3. Feed-forward the network
# 4. Compute the loss(cost/error)
# 5. Backpropogate the gradient of the loss
# 6. Update the parameters(weights and bias)
