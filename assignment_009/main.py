# assignment_009: Training CovNets
# The task is to construct a CovNet, train the CNN on the CIFAR-10 data set to be
# able to classify images into the ten categories using PyTorch.

# Your codes here..
# Steps:
# 1. Define a convolution neural network model
# 2. Define a loss function and optimizer
# 3. Feed-forward the network
# 4. Compute the loss(cost/error)
# 5. Backpropogate the gradient of the loss
# 6. Update the parameters(weights and bias)
